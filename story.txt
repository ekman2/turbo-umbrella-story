Franz had really always liked his umbrella. It kept him dry on rainy days, and it kept him in the 
shade on sunny days. But today, he had discovered something new about his umbrella, it had a 
power switch on the base, and when he flicked it on, his umbrella started spinning. Now he liked 
his umbrella because it kept his feet off the ground.

One day, Franz was turbo umbrellaing through his neighborhood towards the grocery store when
stranger saw him and was astounded by what was happening. The stranger had never seen such a sight
before and wanted to know eveyrthing about it. She followed Franz to the store and when she finally
caught up to him, she asked "hey what on earth is that umbrella and where can I get one???" Franz,
happy to brag about his new transportation device, began explaining the origins of his umbrella.
He explained that he does not know where it came from and why it does what it does, but he was very
pleased when he found out about it. The woman said she NEEDS to know where to get it and the two
set out on an adventure to find out where the mysterious umbrella is truly from.

Intrigued by the woman's curiosity, Franz decided to join her on this new found quest.
The woman's name was Hilda, and the two sat out on their journey together. 
They needed to figure out where the turbo umbrella came from, so Franz thought long and hard about the day that he recieved it.
Franz remembered that the turbo umbrella showed up the night of the full moon!
Hilda whipped out her phone and found out that there was actually a full moon tonight!
